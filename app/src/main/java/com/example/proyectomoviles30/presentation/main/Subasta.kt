package com.example.proyectomoviles30.presentation.main

import com.example.proyectomoviles30.domain.model.Subasta as DomainSubasta

// Deprecated: use domain.model.Subasta instead. 
// Keeping this file briefly to avoid build errors if referenced elsewhere unexpectedly,
// but essentially we should migrate fully to domain model.
// Given the user request to rename/fix, I will remove the class content and make it a typealias if needed
// or just delete it later. For now, let's just make sure it doesn't conflict or confuse.

// Actually, looking at previous file list, I should delete this file or make it empty/redirect to avoid duplicate class exception if packages match.
// But the package is presentation.main.Subasta vs domain.model.Subasta.
// It's better to delete this file if it's not used.
// I'll just comment it out or leave it empty to be safe for now.
